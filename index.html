      The new samsung galaxy s25 has finally been released after months of anticipation after the great sucess of the galaxy s24. It has a main focus on AI features but it still does change some of the hardware, most notably with the Ultra model, we get long-awaited rounded corners that wont dig into your hands as you use the phone. The phone will also come with some black trim around the cameras which are said to be upgraded with higher resolution and of course, AI features. It will also come with an increased battery life but it hasn't been tested yet as the phone is only available to reviewers.

      The Galaxy S25 Ultra offers several advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, it features a stunning 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, providing an incredibly smooth and vibrant viewing experience. The enhanced AI capabilities allow for smarter photo and video processing, making every shot look professional. Additionally, the S25 Ultra boasts a massive 5000mAh battery, ensuring all-day usage without the need for frequent charging. The device is powered by the latest Snapdragon processor, delivering lightning-fast performance and seamless multitasking. With 5G connectivity, users can enjoy faster download and upload speeds, making it perfect for streaming and online gaming. The S25 Ultra also includes an improved S Pen with lower latency, offering a more responsive and precise writing experience.

      Despite its many advancements, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra does have a few drawbacks. One of the main concerns is its high price point, which may be prohibitive for many potential buyers. Additionally, the large size of the phone can make it difficult to handle for users with smaller hands. Some users have also reported that the AI features, while impressive, can sometimes be overly aggressive, leading to unnatural-looking photos. Also, a feature many have poibted out is the lack of bluetooth on the s-pen, the lack of bluetooth means you can no longer take photos remotely with it. Also, while the battery life is generally good, the phone can still drain quickly under heavy usage, particularly when using power-intensive features like 5G and high-refresh-rate displays.
